            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Wee, for the generall good of Our Kingdome, cauſed</hi> Our High Court of Parliament to aſſemble and meete, by Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the twentieth day of Ianuary laſt paſt, ſithence which time the ſame hath been continued: And although in this time, by the maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſitions of ſome ill affected perſons of the Houſe of Commons, Wee haue had ſundry iuſt cauſes of offence and diſlike of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; yet Wee reſolued with patience to trie the vttermoſt, which Wee the rather did, for that We found in that houſe a great number of ſober and graue perſons, well affected to Religion &amp; gouernment, &amp; deſirous to preſerue Vnitie and Peace in all parts of Our Kingdome. And therefore, hauing on the fiue and twentieth day of February laſt, by the vniforme aduice of Our Priuie Counſell, cauſed both Houſes to bee adiourned vntill this preſent day, hoping in the meane time, that a better and more right vnderſtanding might bee begotten betweene Vs and the members of that Houſe, whereby this Parliament might haue a happy end and iſſue.</p>
            <p>And for the ſame intent, We did againe this day command the like Adiournment to bee made, vntill the tenth day of this moneth: It hath ſo happened by the diſobedient and ſeditions carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of thoſe ſaid ill affected perſons of the Houſe of Commons, That We, &amp; Our Regall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and commandement, haue beene ſo highly contemned, as Our Kingly Office cannot beare, nor any former age can parallel. And therefore it is Our full, and abſolute reſolution, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the ſame Parliament; whereof Wee thought good, to giue notice vnto all the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and Temporall, and to the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to all others whom it may concerne, that they may depart about their needfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without attending any longer here. Neuertheleſſe, Wee will that they, and all others ſhould take notice, that We doe, and euer will diſtinguiſh betweene thoſe, who haue ſhewed good affection to Religion and Gouernment, and thoſe that haue giuen themſelues ouer to Faction, and to morke diſturbance to the peace, and good order of Our Kingdome.</p>
